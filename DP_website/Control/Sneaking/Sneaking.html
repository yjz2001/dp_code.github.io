        <h2>Sneaking</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>The example you've just experienced is called <strong style="color:red;">Sneaking</strong>.</p>
            <p>- <strong style="color:red;">Sneaking</strong> involves intentionally withholding or obscuring information that is relevant to the user (e.g. additional costs or unwanted consequences), often in order to manipulate them into taking an action they would not otherwise choose.</p>
            <p>- In privious example, when you ignore the <strong style="color:red;">Sneaking</strong> pattern, you'll find those sneaky websites have add extra items without your consent. 
                Now you're left with extra stuff you never wanted in the first place, and it's up to you to remove them.</p>
            <h3>Solution: </h3> <p> 1. You can <strong>check</strong> everything before the final decision.</p>
            <p> 2. You can <strong>leave</strong> or <strong>report the websites</strong> that use '<strong style="color:red;">Sneaking</strong>'.</p>
            <p><h3>Real-world example #1:</h3> In 2015, UK sports retailer sportsdirect.com was found to be <strong style="color:red;">Sneaking</strong> an unwanted magazine subscription into users' shopping baskets during the checkout process. The magazine cost an extra £1, and was added without users' explicit consent or knowledge. If users noticed it, they had to actively remove it from their basket if they did not wish to purchase it.</p>

            <p><h3>Real-world example #2:</h3> Rac.co.uk let user must select “More info” to be able to opt out of sharing information and email spam.</p>
