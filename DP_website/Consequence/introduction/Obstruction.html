        <div class="description">
            <p>Obstruction refers to a manipulative pattern that, once used, results in consequences similar to this: The user is faced with barriers or hurdles, making it hard for them to complete their task or access information.</p>
            <p><strong>An example of obstruction:</strong> Facebook used an obstruction technique by making it easy to agree to privacy-invading settings but difficult to reject them. Facebook's interface had a button to “accept and continue” with just one click, but to reject the settings, the user had to click an unclear button and toggle a switch to the left. This made it confusing for users, and they couldn't be sure if they successfully protected their privacy.</p>
