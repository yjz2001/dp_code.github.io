            <p>The previous example you've just experienced is called <strong style="color: red;">Nagging</strong>.</p>
            <p>- <strong style="color: red;">Nagging</strong> refers to a manipulative pattern that, once used, results in consequences similar to this: 
                the user tries to do something, but they are persistently interrupted by requests to do something else that may not be in their best interests.</p>
            <p>- When you're persistently interrupted, you're more likely to give in and end up engaging in behaviors that aren't beneficial to you. In the previous example, you're likely to eventually allow the website to send notifications to you, resulting in numerous unwanted promotional messages being displayed. It's akin to falling into a trap of distractions, or perhaps even being tricked into wasting more time.  </p>
            <p>For your benefits, you may consider <strong>leave</strong> or <strong>report the websites</strong> that use <strong style="color: red;">Nagging</strong>.</p>
            <p><h3>Real-world example #1:</h3> In 2018, Instagram aggressively nagged users to turn on notifications, repeating this regularly over a period of months. Users were not able to reject the request entirely – their only option to reject was "Not Now", which allowed the <strong style="color: red;">Nagging</strong> to continue.</p>

            <p><h3>Real-world example #2:</h3> Google repeatedly asks user for permission to use location data, only allowing “don’t show me again” to be selected if permission is given, pestering the user until they give permission.</p>
